## Generate API Credentials

Before starting, you‚Äôll need to create a unique key pair to secure your integration with the Sync Savings platform, this will be made up of a private key and public key.

### How to Generate the Key Pair

Generate the key pair with the following specifications:

- **Key Type**: RSA
- **Key Length**: 2048 bits or higher
- **Format**: PEM format (the standard for web security)

To help you create an RSA key pair, visit this resource: [How to Generate RSA Key Pairs](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen#how-to-generate-rsa-keys). This page provides multiple options for generating keys, including using OpenSSL, SSH-keygen, and other methods, so you can select the approach that best suits your setup.

**Action**: Generate your key pair as described, then securely send the public key to your Sync Savings integration contact. You will also receive your distributor ID during this process.

## Customise your plugin

To provide a seamless and personalised experience, the platform can be customised to reflect your brand design.

**Provide the following design assets during onboarding:**

- **Typography**:
  - **Title Font**: Specify the font family and weight for headings.
  - **Body Font**: Specify the font family and weight for general text.

{: .note }
üí° For fonts that are publicly available, please share the font name and weight. If the fonts are proprietary or purchased, provide either the font files or a functional CDN link.

- **Colours (RGB values)**:
  - **Heading Colour**: For main headings and titles.
  - **Body Colour**: For general text.
  - **Primary Colours**: To highlight buttons and interactive elements.
  - **Background Colour**: Main background colour of the platform.
- **Logo**:
  - Displayed during the user sign-up journey within the platform.

{: .note }
üí° Please provide a high-definition image with transparent background.

**Action**: Send your design assets, including font information, colour codes, and logo files, to your Sync Savings integration contact.

## Generate JWT Tokens

To access the platform, you'll need to generate a JWT token containing your user's data.

**Steps to Generate a JWT Token:**

1. **Authenticate the User**: Ensure the user is logged into your system.

{: .warning }
‚ùóOnly allow logged-in users to generate a token with their email and user ID. Failing to enforce this could expose sensitive user data to attackers.

2. **Prepare User Data**: Collect the required user information (see [Token Payload Structure](https://www.notion.so/Integration-Guide-112f377f98a380028f7bd14ff0413d99?pvs=21)).
3. **Create the Token Payload**: Construct a JSON object with the user's data.
4. **Sign the Token**: Use your private key to sign the JWT token using the RS256 algorithm.

{: .note }
üí° The token expiry (`expiresIn`) does not affect the session length, as Sync Savings will validate the token and create a session that lasts for 1 hour, regardless of the token's own expiry time.

**Example in Node.js using `jsonwebtoken`:**

```js
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

const userData = {
  userId: "abc123",
  distributorId: "my-company ",
  title: "mr",
  firstName: "Christopher",
  lastName: "Robin",
  email: "christopher.robin@sync-savings.com",
  dateOfBirth: "1969-12-31",
  mobileNumber: "+447123456789",
  address: {
    property: "145",
    street: "London Street",
    city: "London",
    country: "GB",
    postCode: "EC3N 4AB",
  },
  sourceAccountDetails: {
    accountNumber: "11223344",
    sortCode: "60-83-71",
    accountOwner: "Christopher Robin",
  },
  institution: "Winslow Luggages",
  employment: {
    industry: "marketing-advertising-and-pr",
    occupation: "marketer",
    status: "employed",
    income: {
      currency: "GBP",
      value: 54321.09,
    },
  },
  sourceOfFunds: "salary-or-bonus",
  taxResidency: "GB",
};

const privateKey = `[Your Private Key Here]`;

const token = jwt.sign(userData, privateKey, {
  algorithm: "RS256",
  expiresIn: "30m",
});
```

{: .warning }
Implement secure token generation in your backend, ensuring only authenticated users can generate tokens.

## Direct Users to the Platform

Once the JWT token is generated, redirect the user to the Sync Savings platform.

**Access URL Format:**

```
https://app.sync-savings.com?token=<token>
```

{: .important}
Update your application to redirect users to the Sync Savings platform with the token appended to the URL.
